# Sentiment-Analysis-on-Ukraine-Russia-Conflict
 We analyze the discussion on Twitter about the war in Russia and Ukraine to provide advice on armed conflict, anti-war propaganda, people's security, and the international situation. In this project, we use the "Sentiment Analysis.csv" file provided by Prof. Oleksandr Romanko to train our sentiment analysis models and apply them to relevant tweet datasets, including "Opinion of influencers - tweets of Elon Musk and responses to his tweets" by Prof. Oleksandr Romanko and "Russia-Ukraine Conflict Twitter Dataset" by Muhammad Tariq. The selected data set shows that Internet users are mainly against the war, and most of them condemn the Russian invasion as inhuman and irresponsible. On the other hand, Internet users' concern about the war reflects their desire for peace and sympathy for the Ukrainian people. At the same time, many people strongly support the Ukrainian Patriotic War and use the words "Glory to our defenders!" and other slogans. But in general, pacifism and international aid are the main themes of Internet users' statements.
